    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 4, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>RealBoard.yaomagic</strong> (the "App") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use the App. The App is a drawing board application that transmits images to a paired e-ink device over a local Wi‑Fi connection for use in magic performances.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit personal information to our servers. In particular:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not require or collect user accounts, names, phone numbers, or addresses.</li>
      <li>We do not upload drawings, images, or other user content to any external server by default.</li>
      <li>We do not sell or share personal information with third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Local Wi‑Fi Communication</h2>
    <p>The primary feature of the App is to send the currently displayed image or drawing from the device running the App to a paired e‑ink device over a local Wi‑Fi connection (LAN). Important details:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All communication is local between devices on the same Wi‑Fi network.</li>
      <li>The App does not route this data through external servers unless you explicitly use an external feature that does so (none by default).</li>
      <li>If you pair with a device, the App transmits image bytes required by the e‑ink device to render the drawing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App may request the following platform permissions. Each permission is optional and requested only if you choose to use the related feature:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Photo Library (NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription)</strong>: Requested only if you choose to import an image from your photo library into the drawing board.</li>
      <li><strong>Camera (NSCameraUsageDescription)</strong>: Requested only if you choose to capture a photo with your device camera and insert it into the drawing board.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you deny these permissions, the related import/capture features will not be available but the core drawing and local Wi‑Fi transmission features remain functional.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect information on your device. Because the App primarily performs local device-to-device communication, no centralized server storage is used by default. If you enable any optional features that use external services, please review those services' privacy practices separately.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The App may optionally use standard platform encryption APIs (for example, TLS) if a feature uses encrypted transport. Unless explicitly stated, local Wi‑Fi transfers may be unencrypted; if encryption is required for your use case, please contact us or enable the appropriate settings if available.</p>

    <h2>5. Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not use third‑party analytics, advertising, or backend services by default. If the App integrates libraries or SDKs that require permissions (for example, for importing media), those SDKs operate locally unless otherwise documented.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information to the App, please contact us at the address below.</p>

    <h2>7. International Users & Legal Rights</h2>
    <p>Your legal rights may vary depending on your location. For example, residents of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK may have rights under GDPR such as access, correction, and deletion of personal data. Because the App does not collect personal information by default, these rights are not typically applicable. If you have concerns about data handled by optional features, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be published on this page and will apply from the stated effective date. Minor wording or administrative changes do not imply material changes to how we handle data.</p>
